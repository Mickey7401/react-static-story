        The Tortoise and the Hare is a classic fable about confidence and determination. 
        In the story, a hare constantly boasts about how fast he can run and makes fun of 
        a tortoise for being slow. Tired of being teased, the tortoise challenges the hare 
        to a race. The hare laughs at the idea but agrees, believing it will be an easy victory.

        When the race begins, the hare quickly runs far ahead of the tortoise. Feeling 
        overly confident, he decides to take a nap midway through the race, assuming he 
        has plenty of time to win. Meanwhile, the tortoise continues moving forward at 
        a steady and consistent pace without stopping.

        As the hare sleeps, the tortoise slowly passes him and eventually reaches the 
        finish line first. When the hare wakes up and realizes what has happened, it is 
        too late. The tortoise wins the race, proving that persistence and steady effort 
        can overcome arrogance and laziness.
